**Build production-ready Conversational AI applications in minutes, not weeks ‚ö°Ô∏è**

Chainlit is an open-source async Python framework which allows developers to build scalable Conversational AI or agentic applications.

Full documentation is available [here](https://docs.chainlit.io). You can ask Chainlit related questions to [Chainlit Help](https://help.chainlit.io/), an app built using Chainlit!

## Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```sh
pip install chainlit
chainlit hello
```

If this opens the `hello app` in your browser, you're all set!

### Development version

The latest in-development version can be installed straight from GitHub with:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit.git#subdirectory=backend/
```

(Requires Node and pnpm installed on the system.)

## üöÄ Quickstart

### üêç Pure Python

Create a new file `demo.py` with the following code:

```python
import chainlit as cl


@cl.step(type="tool")
async def tool():
    # Fake tool
    await cl.sleep(2)
    return "Response from the tool!"


@cl.on_message  # this function will be called every time a user inputs a message in the UI
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    """
    This function is called every time a user inputs a message in the UI.
    It sends back an intermediate response from the tool, followed by the final answer.

    Args:
        message: The user's message.

    Returns:
        None.
    """


    # Call the tool
    tool_res = await tool()

    await cl.Message(content=tool_res).send()
```

Now run it!

```sh
chainlit run demo.py -w
```
