## Overview

Add an interactive Google Maps component to the Chainlit conversational AI platform for displaying locations to users with interactive marker functionality. Users will be able to view maps and add markers by clicking, with all interactions synchronized to the Python backend for developer access. The component uses @vis.gl/react-google-maps library and integrates with Chainlit's chat width constraints.

## Context

-   **Existing System State:** Chainlit has a robust custom element system supporting interactive components like Plotly charts, dataframes, and forms. No existing map or geolocation components exist.
    
-   **Gap Being Addressed:** Users currently cannot share, display, or interact with geographic information in conversations
    
-   **Confirmed Requirements:**
    
    -   Use @vis.gl/react-google-maps library for Google Maps integration
        
    -   API key configuration through .env file (GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY)
        
    -   Map takes full width of chat container for responsive design
        
    -   Primary use case: location display with user-interactive marker addition
        
    -   Developers can react to new markers through backend callbacks
        

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements

**REQ-001:** The system shall provide a Google Maps custom element using @vis.gl/react-google-maps that can be embedded in Chainlit messages

_Rationale:_ Essential foundation for location-based features in conversations

_Implementation:_ Using @vis.gl/react-google-maps as confirmed by developer

-   Acceptance: Python backend can create GoogleMapsElement with center coordinates and zoom level
    
-   Acceptance: Frontend renders interactive map using @vis.gl/react-google-maps
    
-   Acceptance: Map displays in chat messages with full width responsive design
    

**REQ-002:** The system shall support marker placement and management with backend synchronization

_Rationale:_ Core mapping functionality for location sharing and points of interest

-   Acceptance: Python can specify initial markers with coordinates and titles
    
-   Acceptance: Users can click map to add new markers interactively
    
-   Acceptance: Markers display with info windows showing relevant details
    
-   Acceptance: Changes to markers sync back to Python backend via updateElement
    

**REQ-003:** The system shall handle Google Maps API integration securely through .env configuration

_Rationale:_ Security and cost control essential for external API usage

_Implementation:_ API key specified in .env file by the user

-   Acceptance: API key read from GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY environment variable
    
-   Acceptance: Component handles API loading failures gracefully
    
-   Acceptance: Clear error messages when API key is missing or invalid
    

### Event-Driven Requirements

**REQ-004:** When a user adds markers by clicking, the system shall notify the Python backend enabling developer reactions

_Rationale:_ Developers need access to user interactions for building reactive applications

_Implementation:_ Focus on marker addition as primary interactive element

-   Acceptance: Map clicks add markers and call updateElement with new marker data
    
-   Acceptance: Developers can register callbacks to react to new markers
    
-   Acceptance: Marker data includes coordinates, timestamp, and user context
    

**REQ-005:** When the Python backend updates map properties, the system shall reflect changes in the frontend

-   Acceptance: Backend can programmatically add/remove markers
    
-   Acceptance: Backend can change map center and zoom level
    
-   Acceptance: Map view updates smoothly without complete reload
    

### Edge Cases

-   **API Key Issues:** Display meaningful error messages when API key is invalid or quota exceeded
    
-   **Network Failures:** Handle offline scenarios with appropriate fallbacks
    
-   **Performance:** Optimize for mobile devices and slower connections
    
-   **Invalid Data:** Validate coordinates and handle malformed marker data gracefully
    
-   **Concurrent Access:** Handle multiple users viewing the same map element
    

## System Flow

## User Interface Requirements

**REQ-006:** The map element shall take full width of the chat container and integrate with Chainlit's design

-   Acceptance: Map container spans full width of chat message area
    
-   Acceptance: Responsive height maintains good aspect ratio on mobile devices
    
-   Acceptance: Uses consistent styling with other Chainlit elements
    
-   Acceptance: Loading states display appropriately
    

**REQ-007:** The map element shall provide essential mapping interactions focused on marker management

_Implementation:_ Standard pan/zoom with click-to-add marker functionality

-   Acceptance: Pan and zoom functionality enabled
    
-   Acceptance: Click-to-add marker interaction working smoothly
    
-   Acceptance: Info windows display marker details
    
-   Acceptance: Basic map controls (zoom buttons) visible
    

## Technical Requirements

**REQ-008:** The implementation shall follow Chainlit's custom element patterns

-   Acceptance: Python GoogleMapsElement extends CustomElement base class
    
-   Acceptance: Frontend component uses provided APIs (updateElement, deleteElement)
    
-   Acceptance: Component works with existing error boundaries and loading states
    

**REQ-009:** The system shall use @vis.gl/react-google-maps library with modern practices

-   Acceptance: Uses @vis.gl/react-google-maps for React integration
    
-   Acceptance: Leverages library's built-in marker management
    
-   Acceptance: Follows React best practices for state management
    

## Resolved Questions

1.  ![white_check_mark emoji](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/2705.png) **Use Cases:** Primary use case is showing locations to users with interactive marker addition capability
    
2.  **User Permissions:** All users can add markers - developer controls through backend logic if restrictions needed
    
3.  **Data Persistence:** Map state persisted as part of message element - developers can save/reload as needed
    
4.  **Real-time Features:** Single-user interaction focus - real-time updates not in initial scope
    
5.  **Integration Points:** Future enhancement - focus on core functionality first
    
6.  **API Limits:** Standard error handling and user education about API key restrictions
    
7.  **Customization:** Basic map controls - advanced styling as future enhancement
    

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:** Map should load within 3 seconds on standard internet connections

**Accessibility:** Must support keyboard navigation and screen readers

**Browser Compatibility:** Support modern browsers as per Chainlit's existing requirements

**Mobile Support:** Responsive design with touch-friendly interactions

**Security:** API keys managed through .env file, not exposed in client-side code

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:

-   **GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY** - Google Maps API key (required)
    
-   **GOOGLE\_MAPS\_MAP\_ID** - Optional Map ID for styling (defaults to auto-generated)
    

## Recommended Implementation Phases

**Phase 1:** Basic map display using @vis.gl/react-google-maps with static markers

**Phase 2:** Interactive marker addition with backend synchronization

**Phase 3:** Enhanced UI with marker management and info windows

**Phase 4:** Advanced features like place search and custom styling
